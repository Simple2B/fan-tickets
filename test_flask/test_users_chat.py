    Questions from the chat to the user:
    - Are you looking for buying or selling tickets or searching for events information?

    If selling then at once the user is asked to register.

    Just searching for an event or a ticket does not require registration.

    Also after user chooses selling he gets in his chat window previous dialog as messages.
    And then the new dialog about registration starts.

    Registration questions:
    - What is the user's name?
    - What is your email?
    - Password
    - Confirm password
    - What is your phone number?
    - What is your bank card number?
    - Please upload your photo

    - What kind of event are you looking for? (music, sports, theater, etc.)
    - What is the location of the event?
    - What is the name of the event?
    - What is the date range of the event? (date_from, date_to)
